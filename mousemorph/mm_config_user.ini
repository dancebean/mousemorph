# MouseMorph settings
# ===================
# 
# This is the MouseMorph settings file. You can edit it (see [1] for detail on how to do that).
#
# For MouseMorph to interact properly with NiftyReg and NiftySeg on Windows or Unix, it must know where their executables are installed.
#
# 1.	Install NiftK using the Windows installer. Compatible versions are listed below.
# 2.	Check the below path to the binary files is correct: the folder should contain reg_aladin.exe, seg_maths.exe, and (many) others. Modify it if necessary.
#
# The variable can be anything you like: xxx = C:\path\to\NiftK\bin will lead to nk.xxx_reg_aladin being available, for example. This lets you use multiple versions, or different program directories, easily.
# 
# Tested on Windows 7 & 10 64-bit and Scientific Linux with:
# NifTK 14.08.0
# NifTK 14.03.0
# NifTK 13.04
